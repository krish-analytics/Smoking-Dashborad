# 🚬 Smoking Impact on Human Health – Power BI Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes patient health data to understand the impact of smoking on critical organs and overall human health. Using Power BI, the analysis uncovers demographic trends, high-risk indicators, and organ damage patterns associated with smoking behavior.

The goal of this project is to transform raw healthcare data into actionable insights through effective data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive visual storytelling.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze smoking patterns across different age groups and genders

Identify high-risk health indicators linked to smoking

Assess organ damage probability (lungs, liver, kidney, heart)

Build an interactive Power BI dashboard for data-driven storytelling

🛠 Tools & Technologies

📊 Key KPIs & Insights

Total Patients Analyzed: 155

Average Age: 57.5 years

Average BMI: 29.2

🚭 Smoking Status Distribution

Never Smokers: ~50%

Current Smokers: ~25%

Former Smokers: ~25%

⚠️ High-Risk Health Indicators

Increased cholesterol and hypertension risk in higher age groups

Current smokers show a higher probability of damage to:

Lungs

Liver

Kidneys

Heart

👥 Gender-Based Insights

Noticeable variation in smoking behavior between male and female patients

📈 Outcome & Impact

This project demonstrates how smoking significantly impacts vital organs and long-term health outcomes. The Power BI dashboard effectively brings healthcare data to life, enabling clear identification of risk patterns and supporting data-driven decision-making.
